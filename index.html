    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The Amazonie is the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world.
      It has a primary role in world ecosystem by participating in the regulation of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and by being home for a very large number of vegetal and animal species.
      But as you will see, the fragil natural environment is subjec to destruction, a major part of that is due to the land use strategy of the three country sharing this area: Bolivia, Peru, Brazil.
    </p>
    <h2> How to use this Visualisation </h2>
    <p>
      This presentation is composed of 2 different parts: <br/>

        <li>An information card composed of 5 tabs:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Map Items: Where you will be able to display the several data</li>
          <li>AOI: The area of interest with some extra information</li>
          <li>Agriculture: Emphasasing the agriculture activity consequences on the area</li>

            <h2>Area of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                The Amazonian forest covers 7 million km2, of which 5,5 million km2 are covered by the rainforest.</br>
                It represents more than half of the world's remaining tropical forests and includes the largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world,
                with about 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species. This region includes a territory belonging to nine nations.</br>
                Most of the forest is confined to Brazil (60%), Peru (13%), Colombia (10%) and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana,
                Suriname and in French Guiana.</br></br>
                In order to preserve this ecosystem, several parts of the Amazon rainforest are protected and 3 of them: the central Amazon conservation complex in Brazil,
                the Manú national park in Peru and the Noel Kempff Mercado national park in Bolivia, are inscribed on the World Heritage List by the United Nations Educational,
                Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</br>
                We are interested here in these three parts.

        <div id="agriculture-content" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                Since 1970, about 18% of the original forest has disappeared due to converting wooded areas into agricultural fields.
                Besides the deforestation, the agriculture in mountainous, watershed areas has adverse effects on the environment,
                notably the alteration of water cycles and erosion.</br>
                In Peru, the cultivation of coca plants (containing the basic ingredient for cocaine) was so widespread during the 1980s and 1990s
                that Peruvian river flood cycles were altered in some areas, making the high-water season unpredictable.</br>
                The quantity of chemicals, stemming from the cultivation of coca, in the water was very high and caused the death of several species.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="water-content" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Water repartition</h2>
            <p>
                Rivers cross almost all the area which is very rich in soft water. </br>
                </br>
                Floodplain forests represent between 3-4% of the Amazon Basin area and are highly productive riverside areas that are flooded during the rainy season,
                and which receive rich sediment from the Andes Mountains. </br>
                But the large quantity of water make the mobility in the area very complicated and it is almost impossible to develop agriculture field in this area.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="mines-content" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Mining activities</h2>
            <p>
                While Amazon mining may not cause deforestation on the same scale as agriculture, it has a wide range of effects that can affect the environment in
                the vicinity of the mining site and downstream from extractive operations.</br>
                Mining pollutes water with run-off from the mine, and threaten local communities.
                A notorious pollutant used in gold extraction is mercury.</br>
                For example, 90% of fish caught by rural villagers south of gold mining areas of the Tapajós River in Brazil were found to be contaminated with methylmercury,
                which is dangerous for the nervous system as well as foetuses, affecting also local populations.</br>
                Mercury also ends up in the atmosphere, from where it returns to forests.
